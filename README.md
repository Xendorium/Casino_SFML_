# Casino_SFML_

Name - Casino(SFML)

Project Casino(SFML) is something akin to a casino simulator.
I decided to create it (as a final project for object programming) due to the fact that the idea of the casino itself and the randomness factor behind it have always interested me,
plus I knew I was going to have fun while writing it.

The application mainly consists of a menu and a choice of one of two (two for now, roulette is planned to be added) games: Blackjack and Slots.
Blackjack is a card game with rules similar to those of real casinos.
Slots, on the other hand, are a typical machine that draws 3 elements from a given pool. The player wins if all of the pieces are the same.
Everything is done in the SFML GUI.


To install Casino, download it from the link below:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1ptLjmJ9gzZZ7fQEpjggwRSpt2MSsj-?usp=sharing
There is an exe file in the folder. It should be launched.
After starting, a menu will pop up, which after pressing the start button will redirect us to the game selection menu.
Then you can enjoy the app.

SFML configuration: downloaded SFML folder - GCC 7.3.0 MinGW (SEH) - 64-bit and MnGW - MinGW Builds 7.3.0 (64-bit) after unpacking I moved to drive C:/
Then I configured Toolchains for the downloaded version of MinGW. I put FindSFML in the cmake_modules folder.
